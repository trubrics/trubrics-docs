Trubrics is a product analytics platform for AI applications. Product analytics helps you to analyse how your users are using your app, giving you the crucial insights you need to improve your product.

With a few lines of code, you can start sending all user & AI events to Trubrics, and answer questions like:

- Are my users using/getting value from my AI assistants?
- What are the new/most common customer use cases of my AI assistants?
- What are the most common issues with my AI assistants?
- How should I communicate the success of my AI assistants to my stakeholders?
- How should I prioritise AI features to build?

??? question "What are user & AI events?"
    User events can be any user click in your app, or a message to your AI assistant. AI events can be the response of an AI assistant, or any action carried out by the AI, such as a database query.

To dive deep into the insights that you receive, you can visit the [Trubrics app](https://app.trubrics.com).


!!! question "How does product analytics for AI apps differ from regular product analytics?"

    - AI models are defining your user's experience on the fly. This means that to understand user behaviour within your app, you also must understand any AI actions that have been carried out during that user session.
    - AI models, especially LLMs, are transforming user interfaces as users now communicate directly with a product in natural language. This means that regular product analytics that just analyse user behaviour through clicks and page views are missing a crucial part of a user's journey.
    - User/AI assistant interactions are a rich source of customer feedback, and will probably tell you more than your offline customer surveys.
