To get started collecting events in your application using Burr, our SDKs have methods to automate AI event collection with a single line of code.

??? info "Install SDK"
    === "Python"

        ```bash
        --8<-- "utils/code_snippets/python/install_pip.md"
        ```

Firstly, ensure that Trubrics is imported & initialised in your app:

=== "Python"
    ``` py
    --8<-- "utils/code_snippets/python/init.py"
    ```

--8<-- "utils/api_key.md"

Now start tacking prompts, generations and tool calls from Burr by using the withProperties wrapper:

=== "Python"

    ``` py
