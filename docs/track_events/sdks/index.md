# SDKs

The Trubrics SDKs are libraries that allow you to track events in your application. Libraries are non-blocking and super fast, so you can be sure that they won't slow down your application.

## Python
- [Getting started](python.md)
- [LLM tracking](python_llm_tracking.md)

## Javascript
- [Getting started](node.md)
- [LLM tracking](node_llm_tracking.md)

Or use directly our [Rest API](../../api_reference/index.md).
